== calculate-tp-hash ==
This program returns the tp_hash of the given .po.
(tp_hash is a much better .pot identifier than {pot_path, pot_creation_date}!)

Testing:
	./calculate-tp-hash ~/messages/kdepimlibs/libkcalutils.po

== iddiff ==
This program generates a list of differences between 2 .po files.
The .po files should be based on the same .pot (even the order
of messages should be the same).
Obsolete messages should go after all other messages.

Testing:
	./iddiff dolphin1.po dolphin2.po 100
