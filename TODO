1. Eliminate usage of temporary files in the whole 'stupid-ids' project. (use "grep tempfile")
2. Which version of Gettext is required for po_message_is_range()? Add a dependency to CMakeLists.txt
3. Add obsolete messages to .po files when .iddiff does not completely apply
4. Script that reverts all files changes in an SVN working copy that are already "diffed" into "stupids-rerere/"
5. Initialize credits in comments in the beginning of .po file with patching a clean .pot, add new credits when patching existing .po file. Initialize "Last-Translator:" and "PO-Revision-Date:" header fields.
6. Switch from libgit2 to libqgit2 (Qt-based) ?
7. For command line applications, use a C++ library (look for those!) for parsing command line options.
8. Rewrite TCP/IP server in Apache Thrift.
