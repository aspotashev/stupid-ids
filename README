Assumptions:
1. A pair {POT creation date; POT basename} can be used to identify a POT.
2. The strings in 2 identical POTs (but with possibly different basenames) are always translated the same way.


How to setup stupid-ids:
1. Create and regularly update a Git repository with translation
	templates (.pot file). In the following commands we will
	assume the path the that Git repository to be "/path/to/git-templates".
2.
	cd stupid-id-filler
	./sif-init.sh ids
	./add-templates-from-repo.rb ~/kde-ru/xx-numbering/templates ./ids


Components:
== dump-ids ==
Writes a list of pairs of IDs in two .pot templates.

== stupid-id-filler ==
Chooses IDs for .pot templates. Maintains the map [pot_sha] -> [first ID in .pot].

== successor-detector ==

== stupid-id-merger ==
